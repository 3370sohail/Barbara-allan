            <p>"I use photography as a means of telling a story. I am drawn to detail, places and moments in time. I appreciate simplicity, things historical, the joy and beauty of nature and the majesty and inspiration of fine architecture. I am captivated by the experiences of those who have gone before and left us with things to ponder on, to wonder about - pieces of themselves that continue to enrich our present day experience. Light, darkness and silence, in all their myriad forms, guide me, encourage me and compel me to see with my camera and hold moments in time."
